It is necessary to calculate the current LTV of the user using cohort analysis (cohorting event - trial subscription, the cohort represents the number of possible operations).
Forecast what LTV will be in six months.
Create a graph that will display the actual LTV curve against the forecasted LTV curve.
Calculate the ROMI for 4 weeks and six months, if the cost of acquiring a paying user is 6 USD (ROMI should be taken from an operational perspective, not an accounting one, with the goal of understanding how our investments will be repaid).
